# elements.css

_A CSS framework with a focus on providing good, but also
configurable defaults for the basic HTML elements._

## How it works

elements.css provides styling on elements like `input`, `select`
& `p` to provide a visual consistency that you, the reader can
control with CSS variables if you so choose.. otherwise
reasonable defaults are provided.

```css
provide example config here
```

We _don't_ style generic elements like `div` which are used for
pretty much everything and would get in the way more often than
is useful. When elements.css _does_ get in the way for elements
we do style (e.g `input`) you can use the `.unstyled` class to
ignore what elements.css would normally apply.
